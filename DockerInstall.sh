# search for images on DockerHub

docker seravh hello-world

#Docker first checks to see whether the "hello-world" image is available locally. If not, Docker automatically downloads it from DockerHub.
Docker sets up the container to run locally,including ensuring its isolation from other processes. Once the preparations are made, Docker runs the image.

docker run hello-world


# create docker image
